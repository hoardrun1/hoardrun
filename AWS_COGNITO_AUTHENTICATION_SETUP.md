# AWS Cognito Authentication Setup - Fixed

## Issues Resolved

The deployed Vercel application was experiencing multiple authentication errors:

1. **NextAuth Session API Errors (500)**: `/api/auth/session` was failing
2. **NextAuth Log API Errors (500)**: `/api/auth/_log` was failing  
3. **CORS Issues**: Auth backend calls were being blocked
4. **Auth Backend Failures**: `auth-backend-yqik.onrender.com` was returning 500 errors

## Root Cause

The application was configured to use multiple authentication systems simultaneously:
- NextAuth (causing the session API errors)
- Firebase (removed but still referenced)
- AWS Cognito (intended authentication system)
- External auth backend (failing)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Switched to AWS Cognito Only

**Removed NextAuth:**
- Disabled NextAuth routes by renaming `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]` to `[...nextauth].disabled`
- Removed `NextAuthProvider` from `app/layout.tsx`
- Eliminated NextAuth session API calls

**Created AWS Cognito Integration:**
- New hook: `hooks/useAwsCognitoAuth.ts`
- Updated `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to use Cognito instead of Firebase
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing component interfaces

### 2. Authentication Flow

**Sign In/Sign Up Process:**
1. User clicks sign in/sign up
2. Redirects to AWS Cognito Hosted UI
3. User authenticates with Cognito
4. Cognito redirects back to `/api/auth/flexible-callback`
5. Callback exchanges authorization code for tokens
6. Session token stored in HTTP-only cookie
7. User redirected to `/auth/success`

**Session Management:**
- Tokens stored in localStorage and HTTP-only cookies
- Session validation on app initialization
- Automatic token cleanup on errors

### 3. Configuration

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
# Client-side (exposed to browser)
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=11jcq80atebuijov111g5lomu3
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_DOMAIN=us-east-1xu7qloayx.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URI=https://hoardruns.vercel.app/api/auth/flexible-callback

# Server-side only
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=11jcq80atebuijov111g5lomu3
COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=9n2ice18hrjr3lfn9sq8r183jb1kdcjrdhm71e34f86r1u7hfdm
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_XU7qLoAyX
COGNITO_REGION=us-east-1
COGNITO_DOMAIN=us-east-1xu7qloayx.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
COGNITO_REDIRECT_URI=https://hoardruns.vercel.app/api/auth/flexible-callback
```

### 4. Key Files Modified

**New Files:**
- `hooks/useAwsCognitoAuth.ts` - AWS Cognito authentication hook

**Modified Files:**
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Switched from Firebase to Cognito
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed NextAuth provider
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/` - Disabled (renamed to `.disabled`)

**Existing Files (No Changes Needed):**
- `app/api/auth/flexible-callback/route.ts` - Already configured for Cognito
- Components using `useAuth()` - Backward compatible

## Expected Results

After deployment, the application should:

1. ✅ No more NextAuth session API errors
2. ✅ No more NextAuth log API errors  
3. ✅ No more CORS issues with auth backend
4. ✅ Clean authentication flow using AWS Cognito Hosted UI
5. ✅ Proper session management and token handling

## Testing the Fix

1. **Visit the deployed application**
2. **Click Sign In** - Should redirect to Cognito Hosted UI
3. **Authenticate** - Should redirect back and establish session
4. **Check browser console** - Should see no authentication errors
5. **Navigate the app** - Should maintain authenticated state

## Deployment Notes

- The changes are backward compatible with existing components
- No database changes required
- Environment variables should be configured in Vercel dashboard
- The auth backend on Render is no longer needed for basic authentication

## Next Steps

If you want to add additional authentication features:
- **Social Login**: Configure Google/Apple providers in Cognito
- **Custom Attributes**: Add user profile fields in Cognito User Pool
- **MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication in Cognito settings
- **Password Policies**: Configure in Cognito User Pool settings
