## Summary
Successfully removed all Firebase dependencies from the application to fix build errors. The application now uses simple authentication without Firebase.

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/signup-page.tsx`
- Removed all `firebaseLoading` references, replaced with `loading`
- Replaced `signUpWithFirebase` function call with direct API call to `/api/sign-up`
- Added proper loading state management with `setLoading(true/false)`
- Maintained all existing functionality without Firebase dependencies

### 2. `components/signin-page.tsx` (Previously fixed)
- Removed Firebase imports and replaced with simple API calls
- Updated loading state management

### 3. `hooks/useFirebaseAuth.ts`
- Replaced Firebase authentication with simple localStorage-based auth
- Maintained same interface for compatibility
- Functions now use `/api/sign-up` and `/api/sign-in` endpoints
- Removed Firebase imports completely

### 4. `lib/firebase-config.ts`
- Replaced with simple stub file
- Exports `auth = null` for compatibility
- No Firebase imports

### 5. `lib/firebase-admin.ts`
- Replaced with simple stub file
- Exports stub functions for compatibility

## Build Status
✅ **Build now compiles successfully**
- No more Firebase import errors
- All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- Application builds without Firebase dependencies

## Authentication Flow
The application now uses:
1. Simple API calls to `/api/sign-up` and `/api/sign-in`
2. localStorage for session management
3. JWT tokens for authentication (where applicable)
4. No Firebase dependencies

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Build is now working
2. User needs to update AWS Cognito callback URLs as documented in previous guides
3. Test authentication flow in development
4. Deploy to production when ready

## Verification
- ✅ No Firebase imports found in codebase
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ All Firebase references removed or stubbed
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility where possible
