# Remove Placeholder and Test Data

## Tasks
- [x] Remove hardcoded `fixedDeposits` array in `app/(dashboard)/savings/page.tsx`
- [x] Remove hardcoded `automatedSavings` array in `app/(dashboard)/savings/page.tsx`
- [x] Initialize both arrays as empty arrays instead
- [ ] Verify that the savings page still functions correctly without the test data

## Information Gathered
- The file `app/(dashboard)/savings/page.tsx` contains hardcoded test data for fixed deposits and automated savings.
- Fixed deposits include: id "fd_1", amount 15000, term 24, interest rate 4.8, dates "2025-01-15" to "2027-01-15", status "ACTIVE", autoRenew true, roundupEnabled false.
- Automated savings include two entries: "Daily Coffee Fund" (id "as_1", amount 5, frequency "DAILY", nextDeduction "2025-10-06", totalSaved 450) and "Weekly Grocery Savings" (id "as_2", amount 50, frequency "WEEKLY", nextDeduction "2025-10-12", totalSaved 1200).
- The component fetches real analytics data from APIs, so the hardcoded arrays are placeholders.

## Plan
- Edit `app/(dashboard)/savings/page.tsx` to replace the hardcoded arrays with empty arrays.
- Ensure the state initialization remains the same structure but without data.
- Test the page to confirm it loads without errors and relies on dynamic data.

## Followup Steps
- Run the application and navigate to the savings page to verify functionality.
- Check if any components break due to empty arrays and adjust if necessary.
